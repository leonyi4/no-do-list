This is a Full STACK app using PERN tech stack.

I created a PostGRES database and used Express to create a REST api that allowed my frontend to connect with my database through my server.
I used React Router to create a Multipage React website and used Material UI icons and components to make my components look beautiful.
I am using a Robo Mono font from google fonts.
I also used React Intersection Observer to add animation timings for my components.
